# zio-todo (Scala 3 + ZIO 2)

Implementation of the TODO backend in Scala 3 using ZIO 2.1.

### Main goals
The main goals of this implementation are to show how to:

- build ZIO-based microservice, including metrics and scheduled tasks,
- integrate **Doobie** with ZIO,
- use testcontainers to test repositories
  - examples for both sequential and parallel test executions using single testcontainer.

### TODO

- add HTTP API unit tests
